**Identifying a Good Engineering Problem**

What do you wish was easier?

*Knowing whether an article was worth reading, and whether the amount of attention it gets is proportionate to the amount of comments it gets.*

What utility, API, or library could have the most impact on your day to day life?

*Being able to scrap metadata about articles and filter them using that data. For example, on the ycombinator news site.*

What can I automate that would make myself and others more productive?

*I could automate a process which reads the number of Points each Article has, and compares it to the number of Comments that same Article has.*

How could you make your colleagues' day more fun, interesting, or relevant?

*I could share this information with them on an hourly basis, so they could go leave a comment in the most (or least, depending on preference) popular and trending articles.*
